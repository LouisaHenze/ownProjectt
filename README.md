# My own Project - Example of README File
This is just some normal text. You could explain how to use the program that is contained in this directory. 
You can also incorporate code snippets like

    int x_offset = 5;
    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++){
        x_offset += 2;
    }
    std::cout << "X-Offset is " << x_offset << std::endl;

Maybe you also have to explain some mathematical aspects of your algorithm. THen you can use formulas to explain matrix multiplication for instance: $(AB)_{ij} = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n} a_{ik}b_{kj}$.

And you can incorporate images to illustrate your algorithm like
